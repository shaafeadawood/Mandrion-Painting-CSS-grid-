# Mandrion-Painting-CSS-grid-
I recreated Piet Mondrianâ€™s abstract art using CSS Grid. The design arranges bold primary colors and black grid lines with grid-template-areas, grid-column, and grid-row. Made with HTML5 and CSS3, this project helped me practice CSS Grid while creating a responsive and structured layout.
